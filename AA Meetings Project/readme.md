### AA Meetings

This project is a visualization of the AA meetings in Manhattan. After information was scraped and cleaned from [this](http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/areamap.cfm?boro=M) website, the google API was used to add geolocation information and the final data was stored in a MongoDB database. The  final visualization displays the AA meetings available from now until 4am the next day on a map of manhattan.
